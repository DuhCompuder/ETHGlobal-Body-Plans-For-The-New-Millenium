                    Also titled "Body Plans for a New Millennium"  and written by Jean Racines for his master's thesis. The story will be auto-generated and for each segment, the following will be presented:
                    The code will choose from a bank of visual elements for each segment and compose the background image to fit the mood of the segment.
                    For each segment, the code will choose which text appears on top of the background. This of course means that each segment determines what choices are available in later segments, resulting in an arborescence of the storyline.
