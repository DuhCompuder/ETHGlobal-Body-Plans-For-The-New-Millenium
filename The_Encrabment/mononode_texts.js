Tens of thousands of crablings, still no bigger than the pit of a peach, started emerging from their larval carapaces bearing the wide shells and elegant limbs of their foreparents. Driven by a deep, primal urge, they poured out of their ponds and ran desperately towards the water, weaving a tapestry of eager life between the earth and the sea.","Much aware of the momentousness of the occasion, the gargantuan crabs who sired the crablings had taken post around the shore to bear witness. As soon as they saw their young cascading towards them, they raised their pincers to the sky and erupted in joyous gurgling. They tried to stay still to avoid accidental trampling, but they couldn\’t help themselves: there was a song in their limbs, and so they marched in place. A little dance.","As the living tapestry of crablings descended upon the shore, the denizens of the mangrove set out to feed. From above, a flock of white ibises took turns to poach the slow ones, which were often the biggest and the juiciest. From the ground, dirt-colored snakes took crablings by the mouthful and raccoons choked from biting more than they could chew. The gargantuan crabs, compelled by an incomprehensible fury, ran across the shore trying to drive away the attackers, flailing and gurgling desperately. For every predator they repelled, however, another would join the feeding. A group of laborious ants could consume a crabling, and so could, in the water, the maw of a lemon shark."]

Enduring the pains of gravity and dry air, they climbed a nearby hill and placed their bounty upon the summit. Once the pile had grown taller than even the tallest of crabs and wider than even the most bloated of carapaces, they all made a circle around it and sang, claw in claw, a sad gurgling of remembrance. As if a surrogate weep, it started to rain.","Hidden amid the surrounding trees and bushes, a battalion of hostile crustaceans waited patiently for the mourners to be completely absorbed in song. As a deep sadness settled into the chanters\’ cephalothoraxes, the attackers flung themselves against the chanters with reckless disregard.

They could not swim nimbly enough to escape its maw, nor fast enough to seek refuge in the ocean floor. The shark, content with ramming against the haphazard cluster of crabs with an eager jaw, devoured them by the mouthful. Some younglings jerked around in terror, swimming in circles until the shark got around to poach them. Others, however, allowed themselves to be taken by a kinship of movement. The chaotic cluster of crabs started to assume form: a sphere, a wave, a meander. They would no longer rely on their own bodies but in a shared sense of space. Not two eyes, but many. Not ten limbs, but hundreds. And so they danced. The protean cluster warped around the shark, caressing its gills, evading its maw. ","The shark, exhausted, swam away."]

Some tripped and tumbled gently onto their backs, struggling to stand straight until a fellow crab tipped them over. There were some, however, who immediately abandoned the safety of the ocean floor and, with little regard for earthly constraints, swam away.","To the bottom dwelling crabs, the swimmers seemed like birds, like dandelions, like clouds, and so they extended their pincers towards the sky, as if asking to be untethered. The swimmers, eager to share the joys of vertical motion, grabbed their sand-bound kin by the claws and moved upwards, as high as they could, and then let go. The uninitiated crabs would tumble back down, desperately jerking their limbs to no avail before hitting the ocean floor. The swimmers would pick them up again, and again, until in the midst of falling a primal engine would start revving, until their limbs remembered how to swim.

As they sought comfort in the rocks beneath them, however, they felt a multitude of carvings, familiar marks that couldn\’t possibly have occurred by whims of the ocean alone. Other crabs had been there before, and the stone was scarred with a record of their itinerary. Emboldened by hope, the lost crabs followed the markings, unwittingly hammering rocks with their pincers and bruising the stone with the tips of their limbs.

After tumbling in angry waters for days, six crabs washed ashore on a small island inconceivably far from home. Starved and broken, the castaways crawled into the island and found it brimming with lush greenery. To their great surprise and relief, they also found it brimming with crabs: a community of gargantuan crustaceans, strong and thriving.","The locals looked distinct, unambiguously crablike, yes, but significantly bigger than the castaways and proudly displaying a bright green tint in their carapaces. When the locals took notice of the newcomers, they gurgled at them in both recognition and solidarity. They dragged the broken crabs back to their burrows and offered them a generous spread of green leaves and fibrous plants. The castaways, with voracious hunger, ate fast and greedily. Minutes later, however, the undigested greens came back rushing out of their mouths. The locals, confused, brought them chunks of shrub and pieces and fern and big green leaves and juicy vines and all the small bits of jungle the island had to offer. The broken crabs would eat them, but every time their ungrateful mouths returned a sad pungent paste. The local green crabs were willing to share everything they had, but the one thing they couldn\’t share was the ecosystem within their bodies, the diminutive organisms that, for hundreds of generations, had evolved alongside them to make food out of place.  ","The castaways, surrounded by lush sustenance, died of hunger."]

Their bodies, now strong and sturdy, could tread the sand with ease, and their hard carapaces were impervious to the hostility of scorpion and snake alike. As if by providence, a burst of rain moistened their gills.","Without losing another minute, the crabs strode forwards, rushing towards the horizon they thought most hospitable. In a matter of hours, they became proficient at inhabiting their new bodies, knowing full well when to consciously steer and when to follow the primal intelligence coded deep within their limbs. Amid their eager strides, there was a constant, joyous gurgling.","Three days later, the desert seemed as incomprehensibly vast as it was when their limbs were still soft and fleshy.
